# re-frame-template

A Leiningen template for [re-frame](https://github.com/Day8/re-frame).

## Usage

`lein new re-frame <project_name>`

## Source

This project is essentially a fork of https://github.com/reagent-project/reagent-template with the cljs parts amended 
for re-frame.

But we're not religiously tracking further changes reagent-template, so at any point this repo will likely be a bit out of date. So, keep an eye on the original.
